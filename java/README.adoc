= gRPC Java

See the official https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/java.html[gRPC for Java] reference guide.

The `java` directory in this repo contains a Maven pom to generate Java code from the `.proto` files, compile the source, and
 package it in a jar file `function-proto-<version>.jar` that can be used to implement a Java function as a gRPC server.

 ```
 ./mvnw clean package
 ```
