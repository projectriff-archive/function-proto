== Function Proto

This repository contains https://grpc.io/docs/guides/[gRPC] service definitions used by the riff https://github.com/projectriff/function-sidecar[function-sidecar] to support gRPC streaming between the sidecar and the function.

To enable gRPC streaming, specify the `grpc` protocol in your function yaml. Additionally, your function must implement a gRPC server, using language specific service implementations generated from the interface defined in the `.proto` files provided in this repository.

riff currently supports only https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html[gRPC bidirectional streaming]. Language specific instructions for implementing a gRPC server are provided in the links below.
